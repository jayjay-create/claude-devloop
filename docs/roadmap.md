# What is built and what is not

## Built and exercised

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `start-work` | Take a piece of work from idea to merged |
| `setup-project` | Set up this repository for devloop |
| `setup-checks` | Build out this project's check suite |
| `untangle-idea` | Map the open decisions in something too big |
| `research` | Answer a question from primary sources |
| `build-prototype` | Build something throwaway to settle a design question |
| `plan-work` | Turn an idea into a specced piece of work |
| `cut-into-tasks` | Cut a spec into single tasks |
| `build-work` | Build the open tasks and merge them |
| `review-changes` | Review a change from several angles at once |
| `record-lessons` | Write down what went wrong so it does not repeat |

## Not built

Names and one-line descriptions are settled; the bodies are not written.
A description is a menu entry: verb first, no trigger conditions.

| Skill | Description | Origin |
|---|---|---|
| `diagnose-bug` | Find what actually causes a bug | Pocock, verbatim |
| `sort-incoming-requests` | Triage issues you didn't write | Pocock `triage`, verbatim |
| `which-skill` | Find out what to do next | Pocock `ask-matt`, renamed |
| `interview` | Ask until nothing is left open | Pocock `grilling`, verbatim |
| `define-terms` | Keep the glossary and decision records straight | Pocock `domain-modeling`, verbatim |
| `clarify-idea` | Sharpen an idea into something buildable | Pocock `grill-with-docs`, verbatim |
| `write-questionnaire` | Get facts out of someone else's head | Pocock `to-questionnaire`, verbatim |
| `explore-codebase` | Read the code and report, change nothing | new |
| `design-options` | Draft several designs and pick one | Pocock `DESIGN-IT-TWICE` + Anthropic `feature-dev` |
| `write-spec` | Write the spec from what was decided | Pocock `to-spec`, adapted |
| `design-vocabulary` | Look up the words for talking about code structure | Pocock `codebase-design`, verbatim |
| `implement-ticket` | Build one task | Pocock `implement`, adapted |
| `test-first-loop` | Write the failing test, then the code | Pocock `tdd`, verbatim |
| `measure-runtime-effect` | Prove a change no test can catch | new |
| `resolve-merge-conflict` | Resolve conflicts by intent, not by lines | Pocock, verbatim |
| `script-manual-steps` | Script the steps only a human can do | Pocock `wizard`, verbatim |
| `merge-and-verify` | Merge and check that it landed | new |
| `find-refactor-candidates` | Find code worth restructuring | Pocock `improve-codebase-architecture`, verbatim |
| `check-docs-consistency` | Check the project documents against each other | new |
| `write-handover` | Hand this work to another session | Pocock `handoff`, verbatim |
| `say-it-plainly` | Say that again in plain words | Pocock `wait-what`, verbatim |
| `writing-for-agents` | Look up how to write for an agent to read | Pocock, verbatim |

Several of these currently live inside `plan-work` and `build-work` rather than
as separate skills. Pulling them out is only worth it where something else needs
to call them on their own.

## Known gaps

- **The aim is idea to a running application; this gets to merged code.** Not a
  bug in what exists — the stated aim was idea to merged, reviewed code, and that
  works. It is the aim that has moved. Five things stand between the two, and
  they are one chain, not a list: nothing runs, so there is nothing to look at,
  nothing to drive an end-to-end check against, and no reason to write down how
  to run it.
  - **How the user sees it.** After every task they get a diff and review
    findings, never the thing itself. Whether the work is going in the right
    direction is not visible in a diff, and asking them to start it by hand
    contradicts the promise that they need no commands. `environment.md` — the
    file meant to record how this project runs locally — has said "nothing to run
    yet" in every project set up so far, because no step ever needs it.
  - **How the interface gets decided.** Nothing in the set draws a UI, chooses a
    layout, or settles what a screen should feel like. `build-prototype` has a UI
    branch, but only inside a map, only for one question at a time.
  - **How the stack gets chosen.** Language, runtime, framework, database. A spec
    presumes them; nothing ever picks them, so they arrive by whatever the first
    task happened to reach for.
  - **How it gets documented and shipped.** Nothing writes documentation for the
    people who will use or run the thing, and nothing takes it from a green main
    branch to somewhere it is actually running — deployment, configuration,
    secrets, the first release, what to do when it breaks. The workflow's own
    documents are written for agents; the app's are written for nobody.
  - **Which further skills belong in the loop when the work is done with AI.**
    Named as candidates, not evaluated: documentation lookup for current library
    APIs, frontend design guidance, browser-driving for end-to-end checks. The
    end-to-end check class is empty in every project so far, which follows
    directly from the first item: nothing is ever running to drive.
- **`build-work` step 2 lists ready tasks without saying what each unblocks.**
  The step asks for it; three runs in a row gave titles and descriptions only.
  Harmless while tasks are independent, misleading as soon as they are not.
- **A finding announced as filed is not always filed.** One run said it would
  record a point as an issue and the issue list did not grow. Nothing checks that
  a promised issue exists.
- **Refreshing the control documents opens a pull request for a five-character
  change.** Correct by the rules — never merge directly — and out of proportion.
  Worth revisiting only with a rule that does not carve an exception into that
  one.
- **Not everything is exercised yet.** Version 0.40.0 has not been run: the
  entry point proposing the next step by title on a map in flight, and the
  session-end handover naming the next question. `devloop-test-i` holds a map
  with open tickets if it has not been deleted.
- **devloop's own repository is not set up with devloop.** There is no
  `docs/agents/` here, so the hooks this plugin ships stay inert while you work
  on the plugin itself — including the main-branch guard.
- **End-to-end testing has no worked-out approach.** The class exists in
  `checks.md`; nothing fills it.
- **Only one stack has been exercised**: a small Python project with GitHub
  Issues. Other languages, other trackers, monorepos — all untested.

## Names that were rejected

Kept so nobody re-proposes them: `plan-feature` and `build-feature` (the pair
implied planning was not building), `settle-open-questions` (too vague),
`split-into-tickets` (everything else says "task"), `clarify-idea-no-repo`
(the case does not exist in Claude Code), `map-decisions` and `sort-big-idea`
(lost to `untangle-idea`).

Never reuse the names of skills Claude Code ships: `doctor`, `code-review`,
`batch`, `debug`, `loop`, `claude-api`.
